# Luck-and-Success
Estimation of luck effect on success.

Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I

## Example
if we had to pick the top 10 people from 10000 people based on their skill and luck (with the luck weight being only 1%), around 6.5 of them wouldn't be picked if we only picked based on skill.
